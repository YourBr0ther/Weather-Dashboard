Okay, I've got some interesting data that I want to think about here for a little bit. 

I am trying to figure out what is actually the best temperature to set during the day and what actually feels comfortable. I feel like I can't ever find the happy temperature and the different seasons don't help. 


ChatGPT said:
Oh yeah, that's super relatable. Finding that "just right" temp is harder than it sounds—especially when it’s blazing outside in the summer or dry and freezing in the winter. A lot of it depends on things like:

Humidity – 72°F with high humidity feels way hotter than 72°F with dry air.

Sunlight – Direct sun through windows can really warm a room even if the thermostat says it's cool.

Air circulation – A stagnant 70°F room can feel stuffy, but with a fan it might feel perfect.

Clothing and activity level – Are you moving around or mostly sitting? Wearing a hoodie or a t-shirt?

But for a baseline, here’s what most people consider comfy:

Season	Comfortable Temp Range (°F)	Notes
Summer (AC)	74–78°F	76°F is a common balance point. Ceiling fans help a lot.
Winter (Heat)	68–72°F	70°F is comfy for most when bundled. Lower at night often feels better.
Night (Sleep)	60–67°F	Cooler temps are better for sleep.
Want to get nerdy with it? You could:

Track your thermostat settings and how you felt (hot/cold/comfy) a few times a day.

Include outside weather, time of day, humidity if you’ve got a sensor.

See if there’s a consistent trend, like always feeling cold at 70°F in the morning but not at night.

Want help setting up a simple logging system or visualizing your comfort data? Or even automate comfort zones with smart thermostats?

I have external temperatures/humidity being saved, I've got my AC temperatures saved, I have what the room temperature/humidity is. 


ChatGPT said:
Perfect! That’s a goldmine for figuring out your ideal comfort zones. You’re already way ahead of most people.

Here’s what you could do next to extract some real insight:

🔍 Goal: Identify what conditions = actual comfort.
You’d ideally want to log or estimate:

Your perceived comfort during those times (comfy / cold / warm / sweaty / etc.)

The room temp, room humidity, external temp/humidity

AC set temp, time of day, and maybe sun exposure or activity level if you can.

🧠 Approach:
We could structure it like this:

Timestamp	Room Temp	Room Humidity	Outside Temp	Outside Humidity	AC Setpoint	Time of Day	Comfort Level
2025-04-01 08:00	70°F	45%	60°F	55%	68°F	Morning	Slightly Cold
2025-04-01 13:00	75°F	50%	78°F	65%	72°F	Afternoon	Comfortable
With enough data points (even just 1–2 weeks of notes), we could visualize:

Comfort zone by room temp + humidity

How outside temp impacts comfort

The best AC setpoint ranges per time of day or weather pattern

Want Help With:
A spreadsheet template for comfort tracking?

A Python script to analyze trends from your data?

A dashboard or simple plot to show your comfort zones?

Integrating this into your current system (like Home Assistant, n8n, etc.)?

Drop a sample of the data you're saving (a few rows is fine), and I can help turn that into something visual or insight-driven.

I've got all of this going in a mongodb currently. I don't have a lot of data on them yet, but I suspect I will probably next week. 


ChatGPT said:
Awesome, once that data starts piling up, we can absolutely start slicing it to figure out your ideal comfort zones.

Next steps for when you're ready:

Data Pull – I can help you write a Python script to pull and clean the data from MongoDB.

Comfort Logging (Optional) – If you want to log how you felt during different times, we could build a simple CLI or web input form to tag timestamps with comfort levels.

Visualizations – Plot things like:

Room Temp vs. Comfort

AC Setpoint vs. Room Temp

Room Humidity vs. Time of Day

Correlations between outside and inside conditions

Once you’ve got that next batch of data, just drop a few sample entries here and I’ll help you get rolling on visualizations or pattern analysis.

Do you already have a structure for your MongoDB documents (like the field names)?







You said:
They pull every hour. Eventually, I will have all of my rooms in Temperature_logs. But this is what I have right now. I have some more fields in weatherData, but I didn't feel like we needed all of those. 

sensibo_logs (AC)
Temperature: XX.X
Humidity: XX.X
Feels Like: XX.X

Temperature_logs (per room, I only have one room in here right now)
Temperature: "XX.X"
Humidity: XX.X
Room: "room name"

weatherData
Current Temperature: XX.XX
Feels Like: XX.XX
Humidity: XX

Nice — that’s already super clean and usable. Having this data hourly is perfect for trend analysis, and your structure is already well-separated between sources.

Here's a quick mental model for what we can do once you’ve got about a week or two of data:

🧠 Merged Data View (Per Hour)
We’ll join everything by timestamp (rounded to the nearest hour), and get something like this:

Time	Room Temp	Room Humidity	AC Temp	AC Humidity	Outside Temp	Outside Humidity
10:00 AM	72.5°F	50%	70.0°F	48%	64.2°F	60%
And later optionally:

Time	…	Comfort Tag
10:00 AM	…	"Too warm"
📊 Visualizations We Could Build
Once you’ve got enough data, I can help you generate:

Line charts over time (room temp vs. AC set vs. outside temp)

Scatter plots of perceived comfort vs. room conditions

Heatmaps showing comfort or temp ranges across days/times

AC Effectiveness: temp drop (AC setpoint → room temp after X mins)

🚀 Optional Next Steps
Would you be interested in:

A Python script to merge data from the 3 collections by timestamp?

A way to manually tag comfort levels via CLI or web (only a few data points needed)?

Auto-tagging conditions as “cool,” “warm,” “humid,” etc., to get started without needing human input?

When you're ready, feel free to drop a couple sample docs from each collection and I’ll start putting together a merge + analysis framework tailored to your data.
